/*
Scenario:
You’ve been hired to help a local pet shelter digitize its animal adoption records. The program is meant to:
  
  Allow users to enter an animal type and adoption fee.
  
  Add the animal and fee to a list.
  
  Retrieve the adoption fee for a specific animal when requested.

However, the initial developer left the program in a buggy state, with missing exception-handling logic
and some errors in the implementation. Your job is to fix it!



Instructions
Start by Understanding the Errors:
Run the program and observe the exceptions that occur. Document what the exceptions are and where they happen.

Write Exception Handling Code:
Use try/catch blocks to handle the errors so the program doesn’t crash when incorrect input or unexpected situations occur.

Test and Debug:
Test the program with valid and invalid inputs to confirm that exceptions are handled gracefully
and the program continues running as intended.

    else {
        console.log("Invalid action. Please choose 'add', 'fee', or 'exit'.");
    } 



/*
Problems to Solve

Invalid Input Errors:
  What happens if the user provides a negative adoption fee or leaves the name blank?
  What happens if the user tries to find the fee for an animal that hasn’t been added?

Code Flow Problems:
  What happens if the program throws an exception? Does the rest of the code continue running?

Structured Exception Handling:
  Add try/catch blocks to handle the above errors gracefully.
